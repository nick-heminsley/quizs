# Introduction

---

## Project Overview

- Project Lead: Bulk Offers UI (Jan 2023 - May 2023)
- Goal: Develop a new trader UI for bulk editing of offers
- Stakeholders: UX designers, trading team, management

---

# Situation

---

## Business Problem

- Inefficient and time-consuming bulk offer editing process for traders

---

## Objective

- Create a user-friendly, efficient, and responsive UI for bulk offer editing


---

# Task

---

## Individual Responsibilities

- Planning, and coordinating communication with UX and traders, development lead
- Pairing and teaching the new graduate on the project
- Mentoring the team in good Angular practices

---

## Architecture

- Front end Angular 12 UI
- Java 17 API layer application
- Java 17 Spring Boot microservice
- MySql Database

---

## Team Members

- UX designer, 4 full-stack developers

---

## Daily Activities

- Meetings, delegating tasks, tracking progress, resolving issues, hands-on development

---

# Project Execution

---

## Phase 1: Ideation, UX designs and planning

- Organising initial workshopping days
- Went through 5 iterations of UX, collaborating with stakeholders and incorporating trader feedback
- Improved naming and clarity of UI elements to enhance user experience
- Planned and allocated tasks for the first two sprints, adjusted tickets after each sprint based on changing requirements

---

## Phase 2: Technical Development

- Setting up the base UI with routing and service to retrieve data
- Creating a set of mock endpoints to allow ticket parallelisation
- Handling Data with RXJS observables: Overcame challenges with handling asynchronous data streams
- Using FormControls to handle user input: Gained a deep understanding of Angular FormControls for complex form handling
- Creating 6 Jetty endpoints that connect the DB to the UI
- Handling complex logic around validating multiple updates across different objects

---

# Result

---

## Project Outcome

- Completed MVP a month before the deadline
- New UI will improve productivity and reduce wasted time for traders
- Testing with traders showed positive feedback around new designs and flows:
  - "It's very clear which sections I've adjusted and which I haven't."
  - “Process is clear and submitting the bulk adjustment is clear as well.”

---

## Lessons Learned

- Better able to break down a project into manageable chunks
- Improved knowledge of Angular FormControls, RXJS, and Jackson object mappers
- Overcame challenges with handling complex objects and deserialization

---

## Adjustments

- Take more time expanding descriptions on tickets for better guidance
- Verify object design compatibility with Jackson deserialization
- Ensure UX designs are collated at the end of all iterations

---

# Conclusion
